## Setup

Make sure you have Lean v4.18.0 installed. I recommend using [`elan`](https://github.com/leanprover/elan) to manage your Lean versions. Set the toolchain like such:

Make sure you have `lake` for lean available in your command-line. This allows you to install Mathlib and the standard library.

```bash
lake update
```

Run this command to install Mathlib and the Batteries standard library for Lean. It's possible you won't need this, but if something breaks, try that. If that doesn't work, install `elan` in addition.
